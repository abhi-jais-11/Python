'''
asyncio is a Python library that provides a framework for writing asynchronous, concurrent code using the async and await syntax. 
It is particularly useful for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code, where tasks often wait for external resources (e.g., network requests, file I/O, or database queries).
By using asyncio, you can write non-blocking code that allows your program to perform other tasks while waiting for these operations to complete.

Key Concepts in asyncio
Coroutines:

Coroutines are special functions defined with async def. 
They can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run while they are waiting.

Example:

async def my_coroutine():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Pause for 1 second
    print("World")
await:

The await keyword is used to pause the execution of a coroutine until the awaited task completes. It can only be used inside an async def function.

Example:

await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Pause for 1 second

Event Loop:

The event loop is the core of asyncio. 
It schedules and runs asynchronous tasks, handles I/O operations, and manages callbacks.

You typically create an event loop using asyncio.run() or manage it manually with loop.run_until_complete().

Tasks:

A Task is a wrapper around a coroutine that schedules it to run on the event loop. 
You can create tasks using asyncio.create_task().

Example:


async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
    await task
Futures:

A Future is a low-level object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
It is used internally by asyncio and is rarely used directly in application code.

Concurrency:

asyncio allows you to run multiple coroutines concurrently using asyncio.gather() or asyncio.wait().

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(
        my_coroutine(),
        another_coroutine()
    )
Basic Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how asyncio works:


import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O operation
    print("World")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(say_hello(), say_hello(), say_hello())

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
Output:

Hello
Hello
Hello
World
World
World
In this example, three say_hello() coroutines run concurrently. 
The program prints "Hello" three times, waits for 1 second, and then prints "World" three times.

Use Cases for asyncio
Network Requests:

Making multiple HTTP requests concurrently using libraries like aiohttp.

Example:

import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com", "http://example.org"]
    tasks = [fetch(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
File I/O:

Reading or writing files asynchronously using libraries like aiofiles.

Example:

import aiofiles
import asyncio

async def write_file():
    async with aiofiles.open('file.txt', mode='w') as f:
        await f.write("Hello, World!")

asyncio.run(write_file())
Database Operations:

Performing asynchronous database queries using libraries like asyncpg (for PostgreSQL) or databases.

Web Servers:

Building asynchronous web servers using frameworks like FastAPI or aiohttp.

Advantages of asyncio
Efficient I/O Operations:

asyncio allows you to handle thousands of simultaneous connections with minimal overhead, making it ideal for network applications.

Concurrency:

You can run multiple tasks concurrently without the complexity of threads or processes.

Scalability:

asyncio is well-suited for building scalable applications, such as web servers or microservices.

Limitations of asyncio
CPU-bound Tasks:

asyncio is not ideal for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy computations) because it runs on a single thread. For such tasks, consider using multiprocessing or concurrent.futures.

Learning Curve:

Asynchronous programming can be challenging to understand and debug, especially for beginners.

Blocking Code:

Blocking code (e.g., time.sleep()) can disrupt the event loop and degrade performance. Always use non-blocking alternatives (e.g., await asyncio.sleep()).

Common Functions and Methods
asyncio.run(coro):

Runs the coroutine and manages the event loop.

asyncio.create_task(coro):

Schedules the coroutine to run as a task.

asyncio.gather(*coros):

Runs multiple coroutines concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.

asyncio.wait(coros):

Waits for a set of coroutines to complete and returns their results.

asyncio.sleep(seconds):

Pauses the coroutine for the specified number of seconds.

Conclusion
asyncio is a powerful tool for writing asynchronous and concurrent code in Python. It is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as network requests, file I/O, and database operations. By leveraging async and await, you can write efficient, scalable, and non-blocking code. However, it requires a good understanding of asynchronous programming concepts and careful handling of blocking operations.
