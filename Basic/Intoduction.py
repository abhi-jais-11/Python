WHAT IS PYTHON ?
    - Python is a widely used high-level, interpreted programming language. 
    -It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. 

Key Features of Python?
    -Easy to Learn and Use: Pythonâ€™s simple and readable syntax makes it beginner-friendly.
    -Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    -Extensive Libraries: Includes robust libraries for tasks like web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
    -Dynamic Typing: Variable types are determined automatically at runtime, simplifying code writing.
    -Versatile: Supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming.
    -Open Source: Python is free to use, distribute, and modify.

What can we do with Python?
Python is used for:
    -Web Development: Frameworks like Django, Flask.
    -Data Science and Analysis: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
    -Machine Learning and AI: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
    -Automation and Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks.
    -Game Development: Libraries like Pygame.
    -Web Scraping: Tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.
    -Desktop Applications: GUI frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt.
    -Scientific Computing: SciPy, SymPy.
    -Internet of Things (IoT): MicroPython, Raspberry Pi.

Python Comments?
    -Comments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter during the execution of the program.
    -Comments enhance the readability of the code.
    -Comment can be used to identify functionality or structure the code-base.
    -Comment can help understanding unusual or tricky scenarios handled by the code to prevent accidental removal or changes.
    -Comments can be used to prevent executing any specific part of your code, while making changes or testing.
    
    Ex:
        - # I am single line comment

        - """ Multi-line comment used
            print("Python Comments") """
