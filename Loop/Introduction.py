Loops in Python 
    -Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently. 
    -The main types are For loops (counting through items) and While loops (based on conditions).
    -Additionally, Nested Loops allow looping within loops for more complex tasks. 
    -While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition-checking time. 
    1.for loop 
    2. while loop

1.While Loop in Python
    -In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
    -When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

Syntax:
while expression:
    statement(s)

'''
2.For Loop in Python
   -For loops are used for sequential traversal.
   -For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. 
   -In Python, there is “for in” loop which is similar to foreach loop in other languages. 
   -Let us learn how to use for loops in Python for sequential traversals with examples.

Syntax:
for iterator_var in sequence:
    statements(s)

Nested Loops in Python
Python programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop which is called nested loop. Following section shows few examples to illustrate the concept. 

Syntax:
for iterator_var in sequence:
   for iterator_var in sequence:
       statements(s)
   statements(s)

'''
The syntax for a nested while loop statement in the Python programming language is as follows: 

while expression:
   while expression: 
       statement(s)
   statement(s)
